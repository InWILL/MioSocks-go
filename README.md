Transprant proxy kernel. 

From 2023.11.29, MapleStory-Japan updated Nexon Game Security(NGS), it has been detecting [Netch](https://github.com/netchx/netch) Process Mode as suspicious activity. Tun Mode can use normally, but Tun mode means all connections have to be proxyed. So I have to design a new proxy software.
